# BetterEDU Website

This project is for an internship that I was part of the founding startup company. 'BetterEDU' is meant help raise awareness for mental health among college students and is a platform that they can comfortably reach out for any concerns of their mental health problems. The website was built and designed completely by myself.

## Setup:

1. Have all the dependencies downloaded to run a flutter web application.
2. Have FlutterFire and all its dependencies installed.
3. Requires responsive_builder for the responsive UI: https://pub.dev/packages/responsive_builder.

## How to Run:
1. flutter run
2. You can choose to type: "flutter run -d chrome" for a shortcut to launch with Chrome or change it to any other browser of your liking.
